## 1. Introduction
Duke is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks. More importantly, Duke is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can help manage your busy schedule better than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
